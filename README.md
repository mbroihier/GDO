# GDO - Garage Door Opener - part 1 - user interface

This repository contains an Android App (Android Studio 3) that connects to a bluetooth device, a Raspberry PI 0 W, that closes and opens a relay connected to a garage door opener.

This repository is associated with my other repository, garage-door-opener, which is the python code that runs on the Raspberry PI 0 W.
